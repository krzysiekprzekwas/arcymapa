# ArcyMapa

Project Arcymapa is my symbol of appreciation for the famous polish cook & food critic, Robert Makłowicz. For over 30 years now he visited numerous restaurants all over the globe. As a great fan, I was looking for a way to find out if there are any "Makłowicz-approved" restaurants in my area. I haven't found any simple way to do it and decide to create a map of my own.

## Idea

* Map-centric interface
* Based with Gatsby (with Typescript)
* Backed by graphql data source
* Free to use

## How to run

Navigate into your cloned repo and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd arcymapa/
    npm run develop
    ```

Your site should start at http://localhost:8000
